ðŸš¦ Road Safety Analytics: Interactive Road Accident Dashboard (2021-2022)

**Description / Purpose 

A comprehensive, dynamic, and interactive data visualization tool built in Excel to analyze road accident casualties across the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard is designed to provide rapid insights for stakeholders like the Ministry of Transport, Police Force, and Transport Operators, focusing on casualty severity, monthly trends, and contextual factors like road type and location.


**Tech Stack 

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies: 

Microsoft Excel â€“ Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

Pivot Tables & Slicers â€“ Used to manage and enable interactive filtering of the raw data.

Formulas & Logic â€“ Employed for calculating primary and secondary KPIs and establishing relationships between data points.

Custom Charting â€“ Utilized various chart types (Doughnut, Bar, Line) for clear and intuitive visualization of casualty distribution and trends.


**Data Source 

Source: Road Accident Data (Hypothetical or publicly sourced, covering 2021-2022).

Data Structure: Contains records of â‰ˆ417,883 total casualties over two years, categorized by:

Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)

Vehicle Type (Car, Motorcycle, Lorry, Bus, etc.)

Context (Road Type, Road Surface, Location/Area, Day/Night)

Date (for monthly trend analysis)


**Features / Highlights 


*Business Problem 

Road accidents are a critical public health and safety issue, requiring timely and targeted intervention. Stakeholders need a single, reliable source to quickly answer key questions like:

What is the percentage breakdown of casualty severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)?

Which vehicle type is involved in the highest number of casualties?

How do casualties differ between Urban and Rural areas, or Day and Night?

How does the current year's performance compare to the previous year monthly?


**Goal of the Dashboard 

To deliver an interactive, single-screen visual tool that: 

Monitors overall road safety performance via primary and secondary KPIs.

Identifies high-risk areas based on context (Road Type, Surface, Location).

Supports data-driven decision-making for stakeholders like the Police Force and Emergency Services Department.


**Walkthrough of Key Visuals (KPIs & Charts) 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Casualties: 417,883

Fatal Casualties: 7,135 (1.7% of total)

Slight Casualties: 351,436 (84.1% of total)

CY vs PY Casualties Monthly Trend (Line Chart): Compares 2022 casualties against 2021 casualties on a month-by-month basis to visualize performance and seasonality.

Casualties by Road Type (Bar Chart): Shows the distribution across Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Roundabout, etc., highlighting Single Carriageway as the most common location (â‰ˆ309.7K).

Casualties by Road Surface (Pie Chart): Breaks down casualties between Dry (â‰ˆ276K) and Wet (â‰ˆ115K) surfaces to assess weather impact.

Casualties by Location/Area (Doughnut Chart): Compares Rural (â‰ˆ162.0K) vs. Urban (â‰ˆ255.9K) incidents, indicating urban areas as a higher-risk location.

Stakeholder Panel: A prominent list of all users/departments who benefit from this analysis (Ministry of Transport, Police Force, Transport Operators, etc.).


**Business Impact & Insights 

Targeted Policing: The Police Force can use the Casualties by Location/Area breakdown to allocate patrols and resources more heavily in high-casualty areas (e.g., Urban areas).

Infrastructure Investment: The Casualties by Road Type and Road Surface data can guide the Ministry of Transport and Road Transport Department on prioritizing road maintenance or safety installations.

Policy & Awareness: Trend analysis helps identify months where casualties spike, allowing Traffic Management Agencies to launch preemptive awareness campaigns.

Emergency Preparedness: The Emergency Services Department can anticipate peak times and high-risk areas based on Day/Night and monthly trends.
